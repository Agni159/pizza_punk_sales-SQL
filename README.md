## About the Project

### Overview

This project, titled "Pizza Punk Database Management," focuses on creating and managing a database for a fictional pizza outlet named Pizza Punk.
The primary objective is to demonstrate the use of SQL Workbench to import data from CSV files, convert this data into SQL tables, and perform various SQL queries to retrieve and manipulate the data.

### Project Details
**Data Source:**
The data for Pizza Punk is stored in CSV files, which include details about the menu, orders, customers, and employees. These CSV files serve as the primary data source for the project.

**Tools and Technologies:**
- **SQL Workbench:** A unified, cross-platform, open-source software that provides a robust environment for working with SQL databases.
- **CSV Files:** Used as the initial format for storing data.

**Process:**
1. **Importing Data:**
   - The CSV files were imported into SQL Workbench using the Import Wizard. This tool facilitated the seamless conversion of CSV data into SQL tables, ensuring data integrity and proper structuring.

2. **Data Conversion:**
   - During the import process, the CSV data was transformed into relational tables within the SQL database. Each CSV file corresponded to a specific table, such as `Menu`, `Orders`, `Customers`, and `Employees`.

3. **SQL Queries:**
   - Various SQL queries were executed to retrieve and analyze the data. These queries included operations such as:
     - Selecting specific records based on certain criteria.
     - Joining multiple tables to extract comprehensive information.
     - Aggregating data to generate summaries and reports.
     - Updating and deleting records to maintain data accuracy and relevance.

### Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are:
- To demonstrate the process of importing CSV data into a SQL database.
- To showcase the application of SQL queries for data retrieval and analysis.
- To provide insights into the operations and management of a pizza outlet through structured data analysis.

### Conclusion
The "Pizza Punk Database Management" project serves as a practical example of how CSV data can be effectively managed using SQL Workbench. By importing CSV files, converting them into tables, 
and applying various SQL queries, the project highlights essential database management skills and provides valuable insights into the operations of a pizza outlet.
